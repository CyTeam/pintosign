# Database configuration
# ======================
# This file can be use as a template for the database.yml file.
#
# If you're using the SQLite3 file-based database, all you have
# to do is copy this file to database.yml.
#
# For production environments MySQL is a better fit. In this
# case you need to setup the databases and adapt this file:
#
# 1. create the database and grant access
# 2. change the '*sqlite' instances in the Environments section
#    to '*mysql'
# 3. add username and password and possibly host settings in
#    the environment config.

# Common settings
# ===============
# SQLite3
sqlite: &sqlite
  adapter: sqlite3
  pool:    5
  timeout: 5000

# MySQL

  adapter:  mysql2

  timeout:  5000
  host:     localhost
  encoding: utf8

  host: localhost
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
